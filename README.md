# Monopoly Game
A final group project for CSC667 Internet App Design & Dev Fall 2020.

## Members
Yann Sainson - Frontend Developer  
Russell Azucenas - Backend Developer  
Harsh Saxena - Backend Developer  


## Project Description
A web based implementation of the board game Monopoly. As a result of miscommunication, timezone differences, and the situation of COVID-19, the project was unable to be completed. Although this failure left us embarrassed, it taught us a very important lesson in the difficulties of pure remote work and the importance of clear communication.

## What I Learned
- Experience in a purely remote environment
- Importance of clear and frequent communication
- Migration of database data from server to database and vice-versa
- Management of dependencies
- Further experience with JavaScript
- Postgres pg-promise
- Usage of Express and Node.js for the backend
